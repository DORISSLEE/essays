# Bedroom in Arles

Van Gogh's own title for this composition was simply **The Bedroom** (French: _La Chambre à coucher_). There are three authentic versions described in his letters, easily distinguishable from one another by the pictures on the wall to the right.[^1]

**Bedroom in Arles** (French: _La Chambre à Arles_; Dutch: _Slaapkamer te Arles_) is the title given to each of three similar paintings by 19th-century Dutch Post-Impressionist painter ==Vincent van Gogh=={Q5582}.
