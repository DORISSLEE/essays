Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, is a beautiful island located in East Asia. 

The main island measures 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi) . The length is about 395 kilometers(245.4 mi) from north to south, and its maximum width from east to west is about 144 kilometers(89.4 mi). 

Taiwan has a great mixture of urban and nature. We can go shopping in Taipei 101,  but also can go surf or climb mountains.

Taiwan has a population of over 23 million. Most of the population is Han Chinese. And also home to many indigenous peoples, there are 16 indigenous tribes in Taiwan, comprise approximately 2% of the population. 

The official lanaguage is Mandarin Chinese. And we also learn English since elementary school, so many Taiwanese very good at English. 

Taiwanese people are friendly, nice, passionate and hospitable, so it is agreed that this is the most bueatiful sight in Taiwan.

**Geo Landscape**

Taiwan is in an earthquake zone, so every year we experience many earthquakes.

The heavily forested eastern mountains provide a habitat for a diverse range of wildlife, while human land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.

Geologically, the main island comprises a tilted fault block, characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges running parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of the population resides. 

Several peaks exceed 3,500 m in height - the highest, Yu Shan at 3,952 m (12,966 ft), makes Taiwan the world's fourth-highest island. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges remains active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many[quantify] active submarine volcanoes in the Taiwan Straits.

Yehliu Geo-park features all sorts of strange-looking rocks. It is part of Datun Mountain that stretches out to the sea. Weathering, marine erosion, and crustal movement together created the world-renowned scenery of mushroom rocks, sea caves, tofu rocks, candle rocks, and giant’s kettles. Among all, Queen’s Head is the most representative landmark and check-in attraction in Yehliu. Cute Princess, a rock that resembles a girl with a pony tail, is considered the successor of Queen’s Head.<br>
