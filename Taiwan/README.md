Yehliu Geo-park features all sorts of strange-looking rocks. It is part of Datun Mountain that stretches out to the sea. Weathering, marine erosion, and crustal movement together created the world-renowned scenery of mushroom rocks, sea caves, tofu rocks, candle rocks, and giant’s kettles. Among all, Queen’s Head is the most representative landmark and check-in attraction in Yehliu. Cute Princess, a rock that resembles a girl with a pony tail, is considered the successor of Queen’s Head.<br>
