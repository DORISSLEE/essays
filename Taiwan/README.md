**geo landscape**
Geologically, the main island comprises a tilted fault block, characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges running parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of the population resides. Several peaks exceed 3,500 m in height - the highest, Yu Shan at 3,952 m (12,966 ft), makes Taiwan the world's fourth-highest island. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges remains active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many[quantify] active submarine volcanoes in the Taiwan Straits.

The climate ranges from tropical in the south to subtropical in the north, and is governed by the East Asian Monsoon. The heavily forested eastern mountains provide a habitat for a diverse range of wildlife, while human land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.

Yehliu Geo-park features all sorts of strange-looking rocks. It is part of Datun Mountain that stretches out to the sea. Weathering, marine erosion, and crustal movement together created the world-renowned scenery of mushroom rocks, sea caves, tofu rocks, candle rocks, and giant’s kettles. Among all, Queen’s Head is the most representative landmark and check-in attraction in Yehliu. Cute Princess, a rock that resembles a girl with a pony tail, is considered the successor of Queen’s Head.<br>
